**Huffman Encoding and Decoding**

**Overview :-**

This project implements Huffman encoding and decoding algorithms to compress and decompress files. It constructs a Huffman tree based on character frequencies, assigns variable-length codes, and compresses the input file into a binary format. The decompression process reverses this by reconstructing the original file from the encoded binary data.

**Features :-**

Compresses input text files using Huffman coding.

Outputs a compressed binary file with metadata.

Decodes compressed files back to their original content.

Uses canonical Huffman coding for efficient encoding.
